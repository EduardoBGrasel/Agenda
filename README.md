<h2>How it was made</h2>
<p>This is a <strong>DJANGO</strong> project, it was propposed in a course that I was taken to know more about python and Django</p>
<p>How you can see this project implements all the main parts of every website, like <i>authentication, mySQL, html, css, models, views, templates, urls and how everything works together</i></p>
<p>This is the first django project, from a sequence tree, when they get ready i'll post the links here</p>
